	- Hello and welcome to the Skylight REST API tutorial.

	- In this series, we'll be covering how to use the Skylight REST API to work with users, groups, assignments, sequences, and cards in Skylight.

	- Throughout this tutorial, we will be using NodeJS and therefore Javascript as our main programming language. 

	- That said, as the API is available over REST, any language that is capable of making web calls could be used in a similar manner.

	- To follow along with this tutorial, you'll need NodeJS installed on your development computer. 

	- Though the tutorial uses v8.6.0 of NodeJS, any version equal to or greater than that should be fine. 

	- You'll also need access to a Skylight domain.

	- As this tutorial focuses on the REST API, we will not be showing the smartglasses display as a part of these videos. 

	- As you can tell, the tutorial is broken up into separate sections, each of which contains a folder with the video, guide text, and any code relevant for that section.

	- With that, you're ready to embark on this coding adventure. Let's go!
