For notifications, this is a temporary document that explains usage:

The endpoint is /messaging/notifications (In the nodejs code example, it would be "skylight.apiPost('/messaging/notifications', msgData)")

MsgData, or the body of the request, should be something like:

 
{
    "to":userId
    , "alert": {
        "type": 8,
        "message": "This is a test message"
    }
}

The integer in the "type" field can range from 0 to 10 (inclusive), with the following being the result of each type:

0) Calling icon and sound, tap to dismiss
1) Info icon, dismisses automatically
2) Image icon, tap to dismiss
3) Message icon, dismisses automatically
4) Same as 3
5) Checklist icon, tap to dismiss
6) Alert icon, red background, tap to dismiss
7) Check icon, tap to dismiss
8) Message bubble icon, tap to dismiss
9) Reticle icon, dismisses automatically
10) No icon, dismisses automatically
